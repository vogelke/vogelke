-  I'm @vogelke, and I like Perl, cats, movies and trashy supermarket tabloids. That picture was taken back when I had hair, which is some time ago.
-  I'm currently learning how to put some of my existing stuff on github for feedback.
-  How to reach me: email to vogelke PLUS github AT pobox DOT com
